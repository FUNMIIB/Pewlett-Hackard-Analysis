# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Overview of the analysis**
- Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This analysis was conducted for Bobby, an analyst at a company called Pewlett-Hackard. The analysis used SQL to determine the number of employees who might retire soon based on their birth_date, from_date, and to_date. The analysis was conducted to help the company prepare for retirement packages and to identify the positions they will need to fill soon. Pewlett-Hackard is a big company and need to have a solid plan if a big portion of the employee will be retiring soon. The analysis also included identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
